## Briefly About Myself:

My way in programming began in December 2020. At that time I started an offline course for the position of Frontend Developer at an IT school called "TeachMeSkills". In this course I created cross-browser and adaptive websites using HTML5, CSS3. I developed a web applications with JavaScript and React – functional-components, hooks, react-routing, Redux and actively used Git. Diploma – fake online-shop (React, Redux + deploy on Cloudflare). I graduated from this course in July 2021. Unfortunately, I haven't found my first employer yet, but I hope that soon I will be able to join a team of professionals and start my way in the IT sphere!

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
